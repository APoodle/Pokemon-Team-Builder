# Pokemon Team Builder

This is my attempt to make a team builder for Pokémon. This is mainly going to be used to get an idea at your weaknesses for competitive Pokémon, more specifically for Smogon (Pokémon Showdown).
I am currently using this as an opportunity to learn React so that I can eventually make the stats viewer.

## Features
V 0.1
Right now all you can do is select Pokémon... Only with the National Pokédex number... Up to Generation 4... This is very bare bones.

Desired Features:
 -Show type chart
 -Show type weaknesses depending on Pokémon chosen
 -Show total amount of weaknesses
 -(maybe)Create a importable base template for Showdown
